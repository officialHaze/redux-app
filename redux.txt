Redux main topics:
------------------

---> Action - What to do?

---> Reducer - How to do?

---> Store - Object which holds the state of the application

---> Functions associated with store - There are several callback functions that are associated with the store:
                                        1. createStore()
                                        2. dispatch(action)
                                        3. getState()


Topic brief definition:
-----------------------

--> Action - Actions are plain js objects that have a 'type' field. It only tells what to do
             but not how to do it.

---> Reducer - Reducers are functions that take a current state and action as an arguement and
               return the new state.

---> Store - The redux store brings together the state, actions and reducers that make up an app.
             *Note: 1. A redux application must have only a single store.
                    2. Every redux store should have a single root reducer.


Redux principles:
-----------------

---> Single source of truth - The global state of the application is stored as an object
                              in a single store.

---> State is read-only - The only to change a state is to dispatch an action.

---> Immutability, One way data flow, Predictibilty of outcome.

---> Changes are made with pure reducer functions.
